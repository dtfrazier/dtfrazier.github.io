I am currently a professor at the [Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics](https://www.monash.edu/business/ebs). 


Research
======
My research interests are broad, but my primary focus is in the area of simulation-based Bayesian inference. 
This includes novel methodological and theoretical developments in the realms approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), and generalized Bayesian inference. 
My most recent work has focused on the challenging - but critically important - issue of model misspecification in simulation-based Bayesian inference and forecasting; explorations that are really at the cutting edge of thinking in this field.
